        <p class="lead">
            My name is Tavish Skelton and I'm a guy from Missouri with a love for computers.  
            I enjoy gaming, drawing, and fixing computers. I like learning how computers work 
            and I enjoy helping people by repairing their devices. It brings me joy to see the 
            smiles on their faces afterwards. Many family members and neighbors often ask me 
            for help with their phones or computers.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently working toward my Associate of Applied Science in IT Networking.  
            I hope to get a good job where I can help many people with their tech problems.
        </p>

        <h2>My Technology Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve also been learning to write code in Python. I’ve built programs that use GPIO 
            buttons to play games on screen. Along with beginner web design, I’ve learned how to 
            set up PCs, web servers, and Raspberry Pi devices.
        </p>

        <p>
            I sometimes struggle, but I love discovering how to fix problems and prevent them from 
            happening again. Learning through trial and error has helped me grow as a developer and 
            as a technician.
