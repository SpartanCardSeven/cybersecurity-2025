        <h2>Everyday Tips</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>Don't use the same password.  If someone gets the password they could have access to everything.</li>
			<li>Don't leave your devices unlocked and alone in public.</li>
			<li>Make sure to have every device and account you own have a unique password, this makes sure that if someone guesses one of your passwords they won't be able to use the other devices.</li>
            <li>Think before clicking unfamiliar links</li>
            <li>Use privacy settings on social media</li>
            <li>Only use trusted Wi-Fi networks. Free Public Wifi like at McDonalds isn't very secure and people on that network can harm your devices connected to it.</li>
            <li>Backup important files regularly to make sure no lose of important files happen if a virus gets on your computer.</li>
			<li>Make sure to use your Antivirus to scan your computer. You can automate it by scheduling scans daily, weekly, or monthly</li>
        </ul>
